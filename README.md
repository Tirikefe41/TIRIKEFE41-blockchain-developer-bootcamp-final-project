## Author: Irikefe Aniboh

## Introduction:

- Although a far cry from the original goal DAZA aims to promote the utilizes of Cryptocurrencies across Africa using established decentralized retail banking model. 

- This models empowers decentralized actors to acts a Fiat to Cryptocurrency ramp whilst provisioning liquidity for all related transactions.

- For the context of this bootcamp DAZA explores the basic functionalities of a Decentralized Exchange using Smart Contracts.

- The current Smart Contracts allows users to swap between the Exchange's native token DAZA and ETH whilst adding and removing liquidity from the exchange's pool.

- These functionalitiies are trivial compared to existing AMMs but future work would leverage established AMMs like TinyMAN and UNISWAP to route token swaps and provision liquidity.

## Application Flow:

- User visits the DAZA_DEX page having some test ETH balance in their wallet
- User then connects wallet to the exchange and automatically credit with 300 DAZA tokens.
- User gets a UI update of the existing state of the exchange's liquidity pool.
- User can then experiment with the exchange's swap function where you can swap between DAZA and ETH.
- User enters swap amount and is debited the swap amount of tokens and credited the swapped token.
- This action updates the UI with the current exchange's liquidity pool and the native token price based off this.
- User can also choose to add more liquidity to the pool or remove some liquidity from the exchange's pool
